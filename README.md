## Smart Mattress Web App - Development Plan

This project is a prototype web application designed to simulate the control of a smart heating and cooling mattress. It is currently hosted on GitHub Pages and is under active development.

### ðŸ”§ Development Modules

1. **Bluetooth Connection Module**
   - Implements a simulated connection process using the Web Bluetooth API.
   - Allows the user to connect to a Bluetooth device (for demonstration purposes).

2. **Alarm Scheduler Module**
   - Allows users to add and manage scheduled alarms.
   - Currently a front-end only interface without backend or real alarm functionalities.

3. **Heating & Cooling Control Module**
   - Provides UI elements for controlling mattress temperature.
   - Currently only visual design; actual temperature logic and device control are not implemented yet.

### ðŸ“Œ Note:
This is a purely front-end demo project intended for interface simulation and future expansion. More features and logic will be added in the upcoming development stages.
